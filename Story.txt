Today is so cold. I cannot even get out of my bed. I think I will just sleep all day.

But I think i will get bored if I sleep all day. So I will put on my jacket and go outside.

When i walk down stairs, i slip and fall. Then i wake up, realizing i am still in my bed. Everything was just a dream.

I am so glad that this was a dream. Otherwise I will be kiled by my own stairs.
